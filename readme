this is a piglet archive file parser/plotter

Manifest:

    Makefile            # makefile :-)
    NOTEDATA.F          # stroke font file

    db.c                # hierarchical database code and header
    db.h

    gram.y              # yacc grammar file

    readfont.c          # fontfile parser and plotting routines
    readfont.h

    scan.l              # flex/lex scanner
    scan.o

    # some test files to plot:

    testblocks/CDRCFR_I # fineline hybrid design for 2.488 Gb/s CDR
    testblocks/H20919M2_I       # original G-Link PCB design
    testblocks/SLIC_I   # schematic for a telephone linecard frontend

Installation:

    You must have successfully unpacked the tar file or you
    wouldn't be reading this.  Now type "make" and the executable
    "pig" will be built.

    "make test" will plot a simple file (testblocks/SLIC_I).  You
    can manually plot a file like this:

        pig < testblocks/H20919M2_I | ap
